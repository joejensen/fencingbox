JBox PC Interface

The JBox PC Interface will provide a means to communicate
with and alter the settings stored in an IBox/JBox's eeprom
memory.

At present this software is in an unusable state, and has primarily been
designed as a prototype to model potential functionality.

To make MinGW and Qt 4.3.4 must be installed
use the following commands in the pc_src directory
% qmake
% make release
