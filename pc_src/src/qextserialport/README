The files in this folder have been released into the public domain
by the qextserialport project on sourceforge.

They should be periodically updated and any changes integrated with
the rest of the JBox project.  Currently their support for linux
serial port enumeration is limited, and in turn limits us. I encourage
anyone with the appropriate knowledge to help them fix this to
contribute to their project.
